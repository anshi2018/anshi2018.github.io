				<h2>whoami</h2>
			<p>I am Anshi Agarwal, a Masters student in Computer Science Major at University of California, Davis. Bugs in code excite me and I love to resolve them and come up with a optimized solution for the issue at hand.  </p>
			<p>I completed my BTech in Computer Science from Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology Allahabad (now Prayagraj :P), India. I came to USA for higher studies right after my Bachelors in September 2018. I was a coordinator of Web Development Society in my previous university. I took classes for juniors and organized development contests for them during our annual TechFest.</p>
			<p>Continuing the teaching streak, I also TAed for Computer Architecture and Web Programming at UC Davis and enjoyed every bit of the process. Recently I completed a Software Developer Internship at AWS Amazon with EC2 Nitro Team. I had the most learning experience of my life and mastered tools like AWS, AWS S3, AWS EC2. This was the first time I worked in Golang and learnt its pros and cons as well.</p>
			<p>For more information about me, you can scroll through the web pages mentioned above and also my other social media profiles are listed below.</p>
			<p>I recently started writing on Medium, if you have time I would love some suggestions/comments</p>
